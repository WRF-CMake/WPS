Custom configurations
=====================

This folder contains custom configurations that have to be chosen at configure time, e.g. -DARCH_CUSTOM=gnu_example.
While default configurations are meant to provide a zero-configuration quick start for the majority of users,
custom architecture files should be used if unusual compiler flags are required for certain environments or scenarios.

See gnu_example.cmake for how to define a custom configuration file.
See default/README for information on the meaning of the variables.
Note that variables in custom configuration files are always prefixed with either C_ or Fortran_,
except for 'linker', 'CC', and 'FC'.

Note that specifying C/Fortran compilers with the 'CC'/'FC' variables is recommended.
The user can still override them by specifying the same-name environment variables.

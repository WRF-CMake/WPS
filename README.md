WPS-CMake adds CMake support to the latest version of the [Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting](https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/weather-research-and-forecasting-model) model with the intention of streamlining and simplifying its configuration and build process. In our view, the use of CMake provides model developers, code maintainers, and end-users with several advantages such as robust incremental rebuilds, flexible library dependency discovery, native tool-chains for Windows, macOS, and Linux with minimal external dependencies, thus increasing portability, and automatic generation of project files for different platforms.

## Changes to be upstreamed
- `metgrid/src/{read,write}_met_module.F`, `ungrib/src/{datint,output,rrpr,ungrib}.F`: Replace colons with underscores in filenames to be compatible with Windows
- `ungrib/src/cio.c`, `ungrib/src/ngl/w3/bacio.v1.3.c`: Fixed file opening on Windows which is text-mode by default and has been changed to binary mode
- `util/src/elev_angle.F`: Establish compatibility with modern compilers by moving subroutines into module and changing 'extern' to 'intrinsic' for `iargc`
